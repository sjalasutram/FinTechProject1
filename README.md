### Objective
The project analyzes various social and economic categorical data, between the years 1960 and 2015, percentage of Agricultural land area, Food Production Index, Carbon Dioxide emissions (in Kilotons), Electricity Production (as a percentage of total) from sources such as Coal, Natural Gas, Nuclear, Hydroelectric, Oil, Renewable sources, Government expenditure on education and the percentage of population that use Internet in the leading economies around the world. For the pupose of the project, the analysis is based on the following countries:
- United States
- Nigeria
- China
- Saudi Arabia
- Germany
- Brazil
- Australia

### Research Questions
Using the categories data between 1960 and 2015, this project work attempts to find answers to the questions below

1. Is there a correlation between Agricultural land and Carbon Dioxide emissions?
2. What is the trend on electricity production from renewable sources across the leading economies?
3. Which country has the least and most of its population using the Internet
4. Is there a correlation between Government expenditure on education and internet usage?
5. Which countries have the lowest and highest ratio of Agricultural land to food production comparisons
