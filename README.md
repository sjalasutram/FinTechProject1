### Objective
The project analyzes various social and economic categorical data, between the years 1960 and 2015, percentage of Agricultural land area, Food Production Index, Carbon Dioxide emissions (in Kilotons), Electricity Production (as a percentage of total) from sources such as Coal, Natural Gas, Nuclear, Hydroelectric, Oil, Renewable sources, Government expenditure on education and the percentage of population that use Internet in the leading economies around the world. For the pupose of the project, the analysis is based on the following countries:
- United States
- Nigeria
- China
- Saudi Arabia
- Germany
- Brazil
- Australia

### Metadata
World bank provided data for the countries and regions across the world in several different categories. The categories are termed as series_id in the world bank metadata.
For the purpose of this project, the following series_ids were used in analysis

|Series_Id         | Meaning                                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|AG.LND.AGRI.ZS	   | Agricultural land (% of land area)                                 |
|AG.PRD.FOOD.XD	   | Food production index (2014-2016 = 100)                            |
|EN.ATM.CO2E.KT	   | CO2 emissions (kt)                                                 |
|EG.ELC.COAL.ZS	   | Electricity production from coal sources (% of total)              |
|EG.ELC.FOSL.ZS	   | Electricity production from oil, gas and coal sources (% of total) |
|EG.ELC.HYRO.ZS	   | Electricity production from hydroelectric sources (% of total)     |
|EG.ELC.LOSS.ZS	   | Electric power transmission and distribution losses (% of output)  |
|EG.ELC.NGAS.ZS	   | Electricity production from natural gas sources (% of total)       |
|EG.ELC.NUCL.ZS	   | Electricity production from nuclear sources (% of total)           |
|EG.ELC.PETR.ZS	   | Electricity production from oil sources (% of total)               |
|IT.NET.USER.ZS	   | Individuals using the Internet (% of population)                   |
|SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS | Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP)              |


### Research Questions
Using the categories data between 1960 and 2015, this project work attempts to find answers to the questions below

1. Is there a correlation between Agricultural land and Carbon Dioxide emissions?
2. What is the trend on electricity production from renewable sources across the leading economies?
3. Which country has the least and most of its population using the Internet
4. Is there a correlation between Government expenditure on education and internet usage?
5. Which countries have the lowest and highest ratio of Agricultural land to food production comparisons

### Data Sets Used
World Bank provides data from hundreds of countries and regions around the world, from multiple categories such as finance, economy, energy, education, health, poverty, agriculture, employment, population, land use, foreign aid, climate change, government expenditures, literacy, mortality, and patents.

## Future State
To improve upon this project, the following ideas may be considered
1. Identify how much of C02 emissions are from liquid fuel consumption vs. gaseous fuel
2. Is there a correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and livestock production index
3. If the mortality rate per country related to the number of people using Internet
4. How has access to electricity influenced school enrollments
